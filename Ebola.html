            <h2>Definition Of Ebola</h1>
            
                <h1 id="dfn">Ebola virus disease   (EVD) is a deadly disease with occasional outbreaks that occur mostly on the African continent. EVD most commonly affects people and nonhuman primates (such as monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees). It is caused by an infection with a group of viruses within the genus Ebolavirus:</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><a>Ebola virus (species Zaire ebolavirus)</a></li>

                <li><a href="">Sudan virus (species Sudan ebolavirus)</a></li>

                <li><a href="">Taï Forest virus (species Taï Forest ebolavirus, formerly Côte d’Ivoire ebolavirus)</a></li>

                <li><a href="">Bundibugyo virus (species Bundibugyo ebolavirus)</a></li>

                <li><a href="">Bundibugyo virus (species Bundibugyo ebolavirus)</a></li>

                <li>Reston virus (species Reston ebolavirus)<a></a>

                <li><a href="">Bombali virus (species Bombali ebolavirus)</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Of all these, only four (Ebola, Sudan, Taï Forest, and Bundibugyo viruses) have caused disease in people. Reston virus can cause disease in nonhuman primates and pigs, but there have not been cases in people. Bombali virus was first identified in bats in 2018, and experts do not know yet if it causes disease in either animals or people.</p>

            <img src="wash Hands Ebola.jpg" alt="" id="logow">
            
            <p>Ebola virus was first discovered in 1976 near the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. Since then, the virus has been infecting people from time to time, leading to outbreaks in several African countries. Scientists do not know where Ebola virus comes from. Based on similar viruses, they believe EVD is animal-borne, with bats or nonhuman primates being the most likely source. Infected animals carrying the virus can transmit it to other animals, like apes, monkeys, duikers and humans.</p>
            
            <p>The virus first spreads to people through direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of animals. Ebola virus then spreads to other people through direct contact with body fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from EVD. This can occur when a person touches these infected body fluids or objects that are contaminated with them. The virus then gets into the body through broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth. People can get the virus through sexual contact with someone who is sick with or has recovered from EVD. The virus can persist in certain body fluids, like semen, after recovery from the illness.</p>

            <P>Ebola survivors may experience side effects after their recovery. These may include tiredness, muscle aches, eye and  vision problems and stomach pain.</P>

            <p>Ebola virus spreads through direct contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person. The virus from blood and body fluids can enter the body through broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth. This can easily happen by touching one’s face with contaminated hands.

            <p>We have taken you througha brief over view of the Ebola Virus, its a deadly virus that we wish you to take all precuations to prevent its spread.</p>

            <h1>How to prevent Ebola Spread</h1>

            <img src="sraying ebola.jpg" alt="" id="logow">

            <p>We have outlined the hygien procedures to avoid the Ebola Virus from spreading. They include the following;</p>

            <ol>  
                <li><a href="">Hand hygiene (including alcohol-based hand rubs, soap and water, and correct glove use) is a basic component of personal and community hygiene and is an important way  to prevent the spread of infections while providing healthcare. Correct hand hygiene lowers the number of germs on the hands and limits the opportunity for spread, including for dangerous germs, like Ebola virus.</a></li>
            
                <li><a href="">Proper hand hygiene methods are described below. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are the preferred method for cleaning your hands in most clinical situations. When hands are visibly soiled with blood or other body fluids, wash hands with soap and water.</a></li>
            
                <li><a href="">Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer when hands are not visibly soiled. These products usually contain 60-95% ethanol or isopropanol. Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should not be used when hands are visibly soiled with dirt, blood, or other body fluids.</a></li>

                <li><a href="">Use soap and water when hands are visibly soiled with dirt, blood, or other body fluids and as an alternative to alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Antimicrobial soaps are not proven to offer benefits over washing hands pdf icon[PDF – 1 page] with plain soap (not containing antimicrobial compounds) and water.</a></li>
            
               <li><a href="">Use mild (0.05%) chlorine solution pdf icon[PDF – 1 page] in settings where hand sanitizer and soap are not available. Repeated use of 0.05% chlorine solution can cause skin irritation.</a></li>
