                <h1 id="more">Medical Waste Services</h1>

                    <p id="mor">Medical waste disposal is one of the biggest day-to-day challenges faced by healthcare providers. However at A1 Co, we aim at solving all such setbacks- we are aeger to make providers become better providers.
                    By definition, Medical waste is any kind of waste that contains infectious material (or material that’s potentially infectious). This definition includes waste generated by healthcare facilities like physician’s offices, hospitals, dental practices, laboratories, medical research facilities, and veterinary clinics. This includes:
                
                <ul id="mor">
                    <li><a>Anything that is soaked in blood (gloves, gauze, gowns, etc.)</a></li>
                    <li><a>Human or animal tissues created during procedures</a></li>
                    <li><a>Cultures of   infectiousdisease/agents.</a></li>
                    <li><a>Any waste produced in patient’s rooms with communicable diseases</a></li>
                    <li><a>Discarded vaccines</a></li>
                </ul>

                    <p id="mor">Medical waste can contain bodily fluids like blood or other contaminants. The 1988 Medical Waste Tracking Act defined it as waste generated during medical research, testing, diagnosis, immunization, or treatment of either human beings or animals. Some examples are culture dishes, glassware, bandages, gloves, discarded sharps like needles or scalpels, swabs, and tissue</p>
                </p>

                <h1 id="more">Hazardous Waste Management</h1>

                <p id="mor">A hazardous waste is a waste with properties that make it dangerous or capable of having a harmful effect on human health or the environment. Hazardous waste is generated from many sources, ranging from industrial manufacturing process wastes to batteries and may come in many forms, including liquids, solids gases, and sludges.</p>

                <p id="mor">Some industries need a specific type of trash disposal and transportation because it cannot be thrown into a regular landfill. Generally, businesses deal with four types of hazardous waste: listed wastes, universal wastes, characteristic wastes, and mixed wastes. They can be liquid, solid, or contained gas, and are typically byproducts of manufacturing processes, discarded unused commercial products, discarded used commercial products, or pesticides, depending on the industry. A1 Concepts are authorized to transport hazardous materials, industrial waste, and metal materials that are compliant with the US Department of Transportation’s rules and regulations.</p>

                <h1 id="more">Fumigation Services</h1>

                <p id="mor">Fumigation is a method of pest control that uses gas to exterminate pests in an enclosed space. It involves the treatment of the hold of a ship, either full of a commodity or empty. The holds of the ship must be inspected for cleanliness and insect activity prior to loading. If any pest activity is found, fumigation treatment may be required. Additionally, the product going into the hold may be infected and could potentially require fumigation treatment.

                The majority of shipping fumigation is done while the vessel is in port. However, under certain government requirements and permits, “fumigation in-transit” is permitted whereby the vessel’s holds are treated during the voyage.The methods and the gases used for fumigation are selected based on the type of fumigation required and local legislation controlling which products can be used in each country.</p>
